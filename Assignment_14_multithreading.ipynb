    "## Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Performance: Multithreading can boost performance, especially for I/O-bound tasks and on multi-core processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: It keeps applications responsive by running time-consuming tasks in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource Sharing: Threads share resources, making data exchange and collaboration easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified Code: Multithreading can lead to cleaner and more organized code.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Economical: Threads are more lightweight than processes, reducing resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading introduces complexity and challenges in handling synchronization and concurrency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Synchronization Overhead: Synchronization mechanisms can reduce performance gains due to the need to coordinate access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Concurrency Bugs: Multithreaded code is prone to hard-to-debug concurrency issues like race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): In Python, GIL limits true parallel execution in CPython, affecting CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Platform Dependency: Multithreading behavior may vary across platforms, leading to potential compatibility issues."

    "- It happens when different parts of a program are waiting for each other, so nothing can proceed.\n",
    "- To avoid deadlocks, we need clear rules about who goes first and timeouts to handle standstills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "- A race condition is like two people racing to use a computer, and the result depends on who gets there first.\n",
    "- It occurs when multiple parts of a program access shared data at the same time, leading to unpredictable outcomes.\n",
    "- Preventing race conditions involves synchronizing access to shared data to ensure orderly interactions."
